A university maintains a set of departments, each of which offers one or more courses. Every course belongs to exactly one department. There is a general notion of a person, which comes in two flavors: student and instructor. A student can sign up for many courses, and each course can have many students enrolled. When a student enrolls in a course, an enrollment record is created that includes the date of enrollment. Once the course is completed, that enrollment record also holds a grade and the date it was recorded; if the record is deleted, the grade information goes away with it. An instructor teaches one or more courses. Draw a class diagram that shows “is‑a” relationships (person → student/instructor), “has‑a” relationships (department → courses, course ↔ students via enrollment), and the lifecycle of grade data tied to each enrollment.
